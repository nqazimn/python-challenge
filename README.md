# python-challenge
This repo contains my solution to HW3 - Python

There are two folders, each corresponding to the challenge **PyBank** and **PyPoll**, respectively. 

Upon executing the _main.py_ file contained in either of the folders, the results are printed out on the terminal and a text file is created in the local directory.
